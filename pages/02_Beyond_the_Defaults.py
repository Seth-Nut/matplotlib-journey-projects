    ## Project
    Congratulations on completing the **second module** of your Matplotlib journey! üéâ

    You're now equipped to go **beyond the default** Matplotlib charts! To reinforce this knowledge, let's dive into some real-world datasets to use your **creativity** and **coding** skills.

    ### üíæ Datasets
    This project introduces **three new datasets**. All datasets can be found on the Matplotlib Journey [dataset repository](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/data-matplotlib-journey).

#### üå™Ô∏è Frequency of Natural Disasters

##### Description

This dataset is sourced from [EM-DAT](https://www.emdat.be/), the international disaster database and a leading center for research on the epidemiology of disasters. It contains information about various natural disasters that occurred between 1960 and 2023.

- The `Year` column indicates the year of each event.
- Other columns represent different types of natural disasters.

##### Importing the Dataset

To work with the dataset, you can use the following Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pyodide.http import open_url

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/data-matplotlib-journey/refs/heads/main/natural-disasters/natural-disasters.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(open_url(url))
```

##### Interesting Questions to Explore

To spark your curiosity, here are some questions you might explore:

- Which years saw the highest number of reported storms?
- What type of storm occurs most frequently, and does this change over time?
- Are there years that display notable patterns?
- Is there a discernible trend?
- Which decade stands out as the worst in terms of natural disasters?

#### üç∑ Wine Quality



##### Description
This dataset originates from [a 2009 research paper](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) focused on wine quality.

It contains data on various wines, detailing their characteristics and quality.  
Each row represents a single wine, listing the values of its features along with its quality score, which ranges from 3 to 9.

##### Import the dataset
```python
import pandas as pd
from pyodide.http import open_url

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/data-matplotlib-journey/refs/heads/main/wine/wine.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(open_url(url))

##### Interesting Questions
- Which characteristic most strongly influences wine quality?
- What distinguishes a "good" wine from a "bad" one?
- Which characteristic has the least effect on wine quality?
- Are there any features that exhibit a high degree of correlation?

##### Interesting Questions
To spark your curiosity, here is a non-exhaustive list of compelling questions you might explore:
- Which neighborhoods are the most and least expensive?
- What factors most significantly determine the price of an Airbnb?
- What are the most common names among guests or hosts?
- Do certain names correlate with better or worse reviews?
- Is price a reliable indicator of quality, such as good reviews?
